# Svelte Circuits

Just a fun little SVG thing written in Svelte 5 for the purpose of exploring the new state management models. Feel free to browse around the source code - I've made some comments. You can play around with it at [circuitsimulator.org](https://circuitsimulator.org).

- Right click anywhere to open the logic gate dialog.
- Click on one to create it (note there's a small bug where if you've panned the screen it goes somewhere else, I'll fix this at some point)
- Drag any of the dots anywhere. If you drag it on top of another dot, it will connect, otherwise it will create a new dot.
- Drag the middle part of a line in order to make a new dot.
- You can zoom in and out and pan by holding the space bar or using two-finger swipe and pinch-to-zoom on your trackpad.

Note that I've never used this on mobile so I have no idea how the experience will go down!
